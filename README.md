This is port of Desmume to the GCW Zero.
It is based on version 0.9.1.1.

Right now, it is pretty slow and it does not have a GUI but it works just like its desktop counterpart and as a result,
it is very compatible with DS games.

Pokemon Black 2 runs at around 2-5 FPS, depending on where you are in the game.

To play it, put the opk file in the apps folder using a FTP client like Filezilla.
Then on your GCW0, Desmume should appear under the emulators section.

Select a NDS rom (be careful, it does not filter files !) and enjoy the slowness and accuracy of desmume !

For Desmume to run faster, it needs a JIT for MIPS32r2 and a OpenGLES core too.

I have enabled the frameskip and put it to 3.
The GCW0 has a similar control layout to the DS so i mapped them accordingly. (except Select, which is not mapped and is used to exit the emulator)
The Analog stick in the future, will be used as a mouse.
